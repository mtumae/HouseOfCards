# Video to ASCII converter
---

To run locally, simply run the vidtoascii.py file in your terminal after cloning.


This code converts Video to ASCII with python using the following libraries:

- opencv
- PIL

If it works as intended, your web cam will open and capture 30 frames (for now) and save the video as well as the 30 frames individually,
before passing them through a loop that converts each frame to an ascii string based on the luminosity of the pixels in the frame.

*House of Cards by Radiohead was the inspiration.*
